                One approach to spread a crucial message is through
                presentation. BeMe Simulation monitors your speaking tempo
                because:
              </p>
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Studies show that speaking too quickly reduces listener
                  understanding and message retention.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Speaking too slowly might cause the listeners to lose interest
                  in what you are saying, which can harm their ability to
                  understand and remember what you are saying.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <p><b>Recommendations:</b></p>
              <br />

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Before starting a new slide or segment of your presentation,
                  take a deep breath.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Try to think of a good transitional phrase you can use when
                  you switch to the next slide, even if it's something as
                  straightforward as, "Let's move on," or "Let's talk about (the
                  subject of the next slide)." As you go along, this may assist
                  you to relax.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Be aware that speaking quickly or excitedly due to your love
                  for the subiect vou are discussing may lead your listeners to
                  lose interest in what you are saying.
                </li>

              <h5>Filler words</h5>
              <p>
                Confidence enhances the persuasiveness of your message when you
                are telling a narrative to an audience. BeMe Simulation listens
                for filler words because:
              </p>
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  According to research, an audience may feel less trust in a
                  presenter's knowledge If they utilize filler words frequently.
                  In turn, this may cause the audience to have less faith in the
                  tale being conveyed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Although utilizing filler words is a common speaking
                  technique, if you use too many, they may detract from your
                  point or worse. As you use this tool over time, Speaker Coach
                  will gain knowledge.

              <br />
              <p><b>Recommendations:</b></p>
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>If you need a moment to collect your thoughts, pause.</li>
                <li>
                  Take a deep breath to calm yourself down if you are anxious.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Make time to practice more before the presentation to become
                  more familiar with your subject.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you frequently find yourself utilizing filler words to
                  signal transitions, make a list of suitable transitional
                  phrases.
                </li>

              <h5>Pitch</h5>
              <p>
                Speaking in monotone can make it more difficult for the target
                audience to stay engaged or recognize what to focus on.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p><b>Recommendations:</b></p>
              <br />
              <p>
                In order to keep their interest and enhance your communication
                be positive to emphasize the key words and phrases by means of
                adjusting your quantity and pitch. If you are working from notes
                or a script be cautious not to just read from the script as that
                can lead you to be extra monotone and much less natural.
              </p>

              <h5>Pronunciation</h5>

              <p><b>Recommendations:</b></p>
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Be clear and precise in how you pronounce your words. If there
                  are words that are challenging for you to pronounce correctly,
                  practice them carefully until you are assured that you can say
                  them besides tripping up.
